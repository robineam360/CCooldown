# Bugs

Tracked defects for Claude Cooldown. Each has a stable ID (`CCBG-N`) — use it in
commits. IDs never change or get reused; only status moves. Feature work lives in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) (`CCRM-N`).

**Status legend:** `Open` · `In progress` · `Fixed` · `Won't fix`
**Severity:** `High` (data loss / crash / wrong numbers) · `Medium` · `Low`

## Fixed

### CCBG-1 · Usage history is wiped on sign-out / re-auth
- **Status:** Fixed (2026-07-27) — took the preferred option below: dropped
  `historyStore.clear(profile)` from `clearCredentials()`. Both stores are now
  untouched by the credential lifecycle, so `HistoryStore` and `SessionLog` stay
  consistent, and stale points age out via the existing 8-day prune.
- **Follow-up:** nothing clears history any more. `HistoryStore.clear()` and
  `SessionLog.clear()` are now callerless. If a genuine account switch should
  start clean, that needs its own explicit affordance (or the account-comparison
  variant below) — worth a roadmap item rather than re-coupling it to sign-out.
- **Severity:** High (silent data loss)
- **Symptom:** After clearing credentials and signing back in, the accumulated usage
  history/trend for that profile is gone.
- **Root cause:** `clearCredentials()` unconditionally deletes the history file:
  [UsageRepository.kt:71](app/src/main/java/com/robin/claudeusage/data/UsageRepository.kt#L71)
  calls `historyStore.clear(profile)`. But history is stored per **profile slot** in
  `filesDir` ([HistoryStore.kt](app/src/main/java/com/robin/claudeusage/data/HistoryStore.kt)),
  keyed by `profile.key` — it isn't tied to the token/account at all. So clearing
  credentials to re-authenticate the *same* account needlessly destroys local trend data.
- **Fix — decide the intended contract, then:**
  - **Preferred:** decouple history from the credential lifecycle. Drop
    `historyStore.clear(profile)` from `clearCredentials()`. On re-sign-in to the same
    slot, history simply continues (windows self-identify by `resetsAt`, so stale points
    age out on their own via the 8-day prune).
  - **If we want a clean slate only on a genuine account switch:** keep history on
    "Re-sign in", and clear it *only* when the newly signed-in account differs from the
    previous one (compare an account/subscription identifier), not on every clear.
  - Note the inconsistency: `clearCredentials()` does **not** clear `SessionLog` (the
    long-term per-window peak log), only `HistoryStore`. So after a clear, the history
    *bars* may survive while the raw sparkline is gone. Whatever contract we pick,
    apply it to both stores so they stay in sync.
- **Note:** also relevant to CCRM-6 (multi-account) — a dynamic profile registry should
  define history ownership per stable key from the start.
